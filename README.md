## Mini Project for practicing React, Functional Components, Props, with Typescript
### (TypeScript, React, Vite, Tailwind)

- This is a notepad like application which saves any new edits in state and local storage.
- State is loaded from the localstorage so reloads dont matter.
- The application uses text areas and input boxes and their styling to make edits inline.

### Run
- npm run dev

### Bugs
- Resizing textarea feature not working correctly.
